Our Work

Our work has earned us a reputation among our clients. A reputation for innovative ideas, a reputation for creating award-winning work, a reputation for never missing a deadline, and a reputation for being precisely the agency that our clients expect us to be. And how did we create such successful work? Experience. Thanks to our experience, we have been able to differentiate between creative ideas and creative ideas that sell. And in this process, we have also differentiated ourselves from the rest.

Our experience has also helped us go beyond what our clients want and deliver what they need. And the result has been work that creates a lasting impression and partnerships that last for years. Whether it is a campaign, a logo, or just a social media post, we have leveraged our experience to deliver the best. That is why we find our clients nodding their heads in approval when we say- Experience Matters.

What separates Pepsi from Coca-Cola, Nike from Adidas, or Tata from Mahindra? No, it’s not just their products, their people or their logos. It is the way they represent their brand and create a distinct perception in the minds of consumers. All these brands, and many other successful ones, have distinct brand identities that help them stand out in a sea of brands. They have a tone of voice, a fixed colour palette and many other guidelines that help them become a living, breathing personalities. If you wish your brand to stand out as well, you have come to the right place.

At Tempest, we have crafted brand identities for numerous brands. No matter what the size of their company, what industry they belong to, or what they sell. From designing logos to crafting taglines and deciding brand names to finalising visual aesthetics, we have successfully crafted unique identities for our clients’ brands.

Campaigns that are creative are great. Campaigns that sell are incredible. But campaigns that sell while being creative are the best. At Tempest, we have mastered the art and the craft of the latter of the three.

We leverage our experience to dissect your requirements. We read between the lines, carry out our own research, brainstorm intensely, and scour for insights before arriving at an idea. And if that idea is just good, or great, we throw it in the bin. Then, we begin the entire process from scratch until we have the best idea on the table. We dig deep, which is why our campaigns create a deep impact. But this doesn’t mean that we do it all at our own pace. We make our deadlines our gods and stick to them religiously.

So, whether you wish to launch a new product, create brand awareness, or tackle some entirely new challenge, our experience in crafting successful campaigns is at your service.

At Tempest, we have a different perspective on looking at events. We don’t think that events are about just being present at a fair or expo. Or organising a program. We believe events are all about creating a presence in the minds of your consumers! This is why, we prefer to call them ‘experiences’ instead of events.

The first thing that separates our 'experiences' from the rest is our perspective. The next thing is our approach. We start by creating a unique concept. Then, we craft a thoughtful execution strategy that can do justice to the concept. And at last, we work with the best people in the industry to make sure the execution is nothing short of perfect.

Over the years, we have crafted experiences of varying sizes across industries for our clients. From
corporate to cultural, we have successfully created impactful experiences across categories. How? Through our
experience!
