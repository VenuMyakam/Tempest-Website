<h5>The Background:</h5>
	On the occasion of World Photography Day, Tempest Advertising held a Mobile Photography Contest across our branches - Hyderabad, Pune, and Bangalore, inviting each employee to submit two entries.

<h5>MADCLIX</h5>
	The contest theme, MadClix, has been inspired by Tempest's 25th anniversary theme, 'GO MAD' (Make a Difference), where entries should contain elements of madness: Capture the Madness.

<h5>Contest Details:</h5>
	Each Tempestian was allowed to share two pictures taken with a mobile camera. It is no surprise that the majority of the Tempestians actively participated, and we received an 
	overwhelming response. In order to enable a voting system, we created a Micro Site where the public could directly vote for their favourite picture(s). As a result, the picture with 
	the most votes wins the contest.

<h5>The Result:</h5>
	A total of 47 entries were submitted to us, and the voting system was incredibly successful with the winner receiving 1045 votes and the runner-up receiving 245 votes. 
	With the voting period nearing its end, it was a nerve-racking moment. A review of the MADCLIX contest shows that Facebook total reach was 3983, Instagram reach was 4127,
	and LinkedIn reach was 9553. MadClix received 909 impressions, a truly MAD-of-a-kind outreach.
