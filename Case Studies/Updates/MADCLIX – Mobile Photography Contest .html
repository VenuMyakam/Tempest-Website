<h5>The Task & Background:</h5>
In order to increase the traffic and visibility of www.tempestadvertising.com, Tempest Advertising held a Mobile Photography Contest on the occasion of World Photography Day, across our branches - Hyderabad, Pune, and Bangalore, inviting each employee to submit two entries.

<h5>MADCLIX</h5>
The contest theme, MadClix, has been inspired by Tempest's 25th anniversary theme, 'GO MAD' (Make a Difference), where entries should contain elements of madness: Capture the Madness.


<h5>CONTEST DETAILS:</h5>
Each Tempestian was allowed to share two pictures taken with a mobile camera. It is no surprise that the majority of the Tempestians actively participated, and we received an overwhelming response.

<h5>MICRO SITE:</h5>
In order to enable a voting system and analyse the traffic on our website, we created a Micro Site where the public could directly vote for their favourite picture(s). As a result, the picture with the most votes wins the contest.


<h5>THE RESULT:</h5>
A total of 47 entries were submitted to us, and the voting system was incredibly successful through logging on to our Microsite, and a total of 2278 votes were received. The winner, Mr. Gautham from the Hyderabad branch received 53.02% of the votes, and runner-up Ms. Rekha Oswal, also from the Hyderabad branch, received 11.87% of the total votes accordingly.
